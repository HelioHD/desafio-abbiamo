# Orders Handling Project

This project is designed to handle orders through a producer-consumer model. It consists of two main components: the producer, which creates and sends orders, and the consumer, which receives and processes those orders.

  - `receiveOrder()`: Listens for incoming orders.
  - `processOrder()`: Processes the received order.

### Types

  - `id`: Unique identifier for the order.
  - `product`: The product being ordered.
  - `quantity`: The quantity of the product.
  - `status`: The current status of the order.

## Installation
